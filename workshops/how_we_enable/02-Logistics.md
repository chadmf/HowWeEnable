# Logistics for Workshops

## Onsite or Offsite

First you will need to decide if this will happen at a customer's site or at a external venue. Our experience has shown if possible hosting this at a hotel or business center near the client's office is beneficial as it gets them away from the day to day and lets them focus 100% on the event.

### Verify Training Labs are Accessible

Customers will often have security policies on their employees laptops that make it difficult to connect to external resources. Make sure you have customers test and validate all of the material before the scheduled sessions.

## How We Deliver the Workshops

Perfect scenario we like to have an entire week to deliver a fully immersive workshop and hackathon. You can break these into smaller 1 day events with the first half of the day learning a skill in the workshop. Then during the second half of the day apply what was leaned to a real business need that the students are working in their day to day. This helps to quickly solidify the skill and get people excited about what they learned when they see immediate results.

## Hackathon Scoping

Before the event it is best to get people to submit ideas for things they would like to solve after learning the new skills. This way we can make sure we have everything in place to help them be successful.

Example:
Customer has a ASP.net application that uses tls and kerberos authentication. We would need to make sure they have the ability to request dns changes, certs from a PKI and set up auth or a kerberos sidecar.
