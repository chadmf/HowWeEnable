# osbuild.composer
[Ansible Collection](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/collections_using.html) for management of [osbuild composer](https://www.osbuild.org/documentation/#composer).

## THIS IS A POC/PROTOTYPE
This Collection should really not be used by anyone for any serious purposes as
its current implementation is subject to change in non-compatible ways as
different ideas and concepts are iterated upon.

# Installing

To install this collection, you will need to use the [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) `ansible-galaxy` command:

		$ ansible-galaxy collection install git+https://github.com/maxamillion/osbuild.composer

# Examples

Examples of how to use this collection can be found in the [`playbooks`](https://github.com/maxamillion/osbuild.composer/tree/main/playbooks) directory of this repository.
