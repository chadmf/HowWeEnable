# Practice Scenarios

## Objective

This section is intended to help new facilitators work through some scenarios that may come up in the assessment stage, and practice how to work through if they do not have a strategy around specific scenario

### Scenario 1 SCM

Q: What is your strategy for Source Code Management?

A: WE currently don't have one.

Thoughts:

Some people use different forms of SCM, however there is no standard methodology.

Collaborate: Let's work through setting up a strategy using git since it is the industry standard.

### Scenario 2 CI/CD

Q: What is your standard for CI/CD pipelines?

A: We don't have a standard, the developers just do what they know.

Thoughts: A consistent methodology at the enterprise level helps enable developers to deploy faster especially if it has all of the security testing and validation built into it.

Collaborate: Have a workshop to help enable strategy on CI/CD depending on type of work we need to do.
